		<p class='am_p'>Hello, my name is Alaunn. I'm an upcoming junior at Da Vinci Connect, its an hybrid-learning and duall enrollment school. With this we go to school from 2-4 days out the week, with 2 days being mandatory, and we'll also get our AA straight out of high school if we stick to the plan our counselors have laid out for us. I'm big on family, respect, and music. With music being #1, sorry y'all. Some my favorite artist are Brent Faiyaz, Summer Walker, Childish Gambino, Drake(put him & YoungBoy in the same sentence imma need that) and Laufey. I'm also a hooper, something like an Adrian Dantly, Jimmy Butler mix. Below are a list of things that mean a lot to me. I'm also always down for good laugh or talk, some think I laugh a little too much, and I approach everyone all the same no matter who you are.</p>
